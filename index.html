              Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's
              stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a
              tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he
              receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a
              wizard.<br />
              A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him
              to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
